Agents are growing in popularity and while they do it's important to have a clear and comprehensive list of what they can and more important currently can't do. This repo exists to stay up to date with the latest advancements and use cases in AI Agents.

Contributions to this list are welcome. Before submitting your suggestions, please review the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure your entries meet the criteria. Add links through [pull requests](https://github.com/plowsai/stableagents/pulls) or create an [issue](https://github.com/plowsai/stableagents/issues) to start a discussion.
