# Stable Agents - Roadmap 

<p style="text-align:center"> This is a preview of our vision for Stable Agents and the roadmap of what will be possible </p>


- [ ] Customer Service Agents for complex tasks
- [ ] Ecommerce Payments Processing 
- [ ] Creation of Niche Applications for Specific Use Cases in a product (i.e 10 customers might want a feature that before would have been rejected because of the cost to build, now its reasonable to build it)
- [ ] On-Screen Memory(i.e The ability to recall the tabs you open, close them, reorder them and open them when summonded to reduce screen clutter)
- [ Send a Text Message or Phone Call to your agent to know the progress of the task and how far it has been completed ]
